Powerline plugin for Kakoune Editor

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19470159/47966105-ae902f80-e05f-11e8-8ca4-76213449d3b8.png)

This plugin aims to make Kakoune's modeline more context dependent, and beautiful. **powerline.kak** adds coloring, separators, toggle behavior and support for git. Some parts, like git branch and filetype, are shown only if they are available, so there will be no filetype section while you're editing file which filetype wasn't deduced by Kakoune. Also if you're editing file that has no write access, **powerline.kak** will show you a lock symbol near the filename.

## Installation

### With [plug.kak](https://github.com/andreyorst/plug.kak) (recommended)
Add this to your `kakrc`:
```kak
plug "andreyorst/powerline.kak"
```
Source your `kakrc` or restart Kakoune, and execute `:plug-install`. Or if you don't want to source configuration file or restart Kakoune, simply run `plug-install andreyorst/powerline.kak`. Powerline will be enabled automatically on buffer change. Use `powerline-rebuild` to activate it manually.

### Without plugin manager

Clone this repo somewhere
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreyorst/powerline.kak.git
```

And source the `powerline.kak` script from it. It can work on its own, but if you want builtin themes to be available, source every needed theme script from `rc/themes` folder. After that you can use **powerline.kak**.

## Configuration

**powerline.kak** supports these commands:
- `powerline-toggle` - toggle parts of powerline on and off. Supports optional parameter `on` or `off`.
- `powerline-separator` - change separators of the powerline. Some of powerline font icons are supported by the script:
  - powerline separators: `arrow`, `curve`, `flame`, `triangle`, `triangle-inverted`.
  - `random` - randomly selects one from above.
  - `custom` - use your own separators.
  - `none` - no separators.
- `powerline-theme` - change powerline theme.
- `powerline-format` - change order of powerline parts.
- `powerline-rebuild` - reconstruct powerline accordingly to options. Sometimes needed when you modify options directly.

All **powerline.kak** settings are applied in context of a window, therefore you can have different powerlines for different windows.

### Example configuration using **plug.kak**

```kak
plug "andreyorst/powerline.kak" %{
    hook -once global WinCreate .* %{
        powerline-theme gruvbox
        powerline-separator triangle
        powerline-format git bufname filetype mode_info line_column position
        powerline-toggle line_column off
    }
}
```

Lets breakdown this:
- `plug` is a [plug.kak](https://github.com/andreyorst/plug.kak) command that loads **powerline.kak** plugin and configures it with last `%{...}` parameter.
- `hook -once global WinCreate .* %{` is needed because all **powerline.kak** settings are done in context of a window. So to properly load a plugin we need an existing window.
- `powerline-theme gruvbox` - sets the theme to `gruvbox`.
- `powerline-separator triangle` - sets the separator to powerline's triangle. Note that as settings are window dependent new window will use default separator, which is `triangle`. To prevent this either use separate `hook global WinCreate .* %{ powerline-separator triangle }` that will be applied to all new windows, or modify `powerline_separator` and `powerline_separator_thin` global options to your liking.
- `powerline-format git bufname filetype mode_info line_column position` - sets the format of powerline, by adding only git, buffer name, filetype, information about mode, line_column and file position in percents.
- `powerline-toggle line_column off` - disables part of powerline which shows current line and column. Again, you can have this disabled or enabled for certain filetypes or buffers via `hook`s , etc.

You can add your own configurations here. Since all settings are window-dependent you can have different settings for different windows, filetypes, window types, etc.

For example this hook will make **powerline.kak** use random separator for every new buffer:
```kak
hook global BufCreate .* %{
    hook -once global WinDisplay .* %{
        powerline-separator random
    }
}
```

## Making themes

You can create your own themes for **powerline.kak**. Here's the example of good theme:

```kak
# base16-gruvbox colorscheme for powerline.kak
# based on https://github.com/andreyorst/base16-gruvbox.kak

set-option -add global powerline_themes "base16-gruvbox"

define-command -hidden powerline-theme-base16-gruvbox %{
    set-option global powerline_base_bg        "rgb:3c3836"
    set-option global powerline_git_fg         "rgb:d5c4a1"
    set-option global powerline_git_bg         "rgb:3c3836"
    set-option global powerline_bufname_bg     "rgb:a89984"
    set-option global powerline_bufname_fg     "rgb:282828"
    set-option global powerline_line_column_fg "rgb:bdae93"
    set-option global powerline_line_column_bg "rgb:504945"
    set-option global powerline_mode_info_fg   "rgb:d5c4a1"
    set-option global powerline_mode_info_bg   "rgb:3c3836"
    set-option global powerline_filetype_fg    "rgb:d5c4a1"
    set-option global powerline_filetype_bg    "rgb:504945"
    set-option global powerline_client_fg      "rgb:ebdbb2"
    set-option global powerline_client_bg      "rgb:665c54"
    set-option global powerline_session_fg     "rgb:fbf1c7"
    set-option global powerline_session_bg     "rgb:7c6f64"
    set-option global powerline_position_fg    "rgb:282828"
    set-option global powerline_position_bg    "rgb:a89984"
}
```

That is, themes for **powerline.kak** are commands, that define colors in these variables. Each module has foreground and background assests. Note that modifiers like **bold** are not supported yet. I'm thinking about it. When defining a theme, please make sure that text at the end of your command and string that you add to the `powerline_themes` are exactly the same:
```kak
set-option -add global powerline_themes "base16-gruvbox"
define-command   -hidden powerline-theme-base16-gruvbox %{...}
#                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                                       This is important
```
If they are the same **powerline.kak** will show you completion items with correct theme name and execute this command for you. No need to execute this command manually. All you need to do is `powerline-theme base16-gruvbox`.

## Adding your own modules

This is bit tricky part, but you can add your own modules to powerline. To create a module you need this things:

- declare boolean option for toggling module on and off.
- declare string option for contents of the module within the powerline.
- define an update command if youur module needs to be updated frequently.
- create update hooks to update module when something related to it happens.
- define a module command itself.

Here's an example of adding a module that shows current position in percents. This module already exists in **powerline.kak** but still can be a good example:

First, lets declare `hidden` option of `str` type, that will store our position:

```kak
declare-option -hidden str powerline_pos_percent
```

We're not giving it a value here, since our next update command will handle it:

```kak
define-command -hidden powerline-update-position %{ evaluate-commands %sh{
    position="$(($kak_cursor_line * 100 / $kak_buf_line_count))%"
    echo "set-option window powerline_pos_percent $position"
}}
```

As you can see, we're using `set-option` in context of a `window` to update our `powerline_pos_percent` variable. Now we need a `hook` that will update it only when needed.

```kak
hook global WinCreate .* %{
    powerline-update-position
    hook window NormalKey (j|k) powerline-update-position
    hook window NormalIdle .* powerline-update-position
}
```

So after `global` `WinCreate` event happens we update our `powerline_pos_percent` variable by executing `poerline-update-position`, and then we're defining two more hooks, first to update it frequently while we move with <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> and second to update it via timeout, so it could show actual position after jumps and searches.

Now we need a **module** command. In **powerline.kak** every module that you see in your modeline is actually a command, that is being called once when **powerline.kak** builds modeline for you. In this case, percent position is already an existing module, so here's how it is defined:

```kak
define-command -hidden powerline-position %{ evaluate-commands %sh{
    default=$kak_opt_powerline_base_bg
    next_bg=$kak_opt_powerline_next_bg
    normal=$kak_opt_powerline_separator
    thin=$kak_opt_powerline_separator_thin
    if [ "$kak_opt_powerline_module_position" = "true" ]; then
        bg=$kak_opt_powerline_position_bg
        fg=$kak_opt_powerline_position_fg
        [ "$next_bg" = "$bg" ] && separator="{$fg,$bg}$thin" || separator="{$bg,${next_bg:-$default}}$normal"
        echo "set-option -add window powerlinefmt %{$separator{$fg,$bg} â‰£ %opt{powerline_pos_percent} }"
        echo "set-option window powerline_next_bg $bg"
    fi
}}

set-option -add global powerline_modules 'position'
```

There's a lot going on, so lets breakdown it. First, we define a `hidden` command, called `powerline-position`, that will be called by powerline, when `powerline-build` is executed.
In this command we use `evaluate-commands %sh{...}` pattern, because modules involve some logic inside them to properly display colors and different separators.
In this shell expansion we're declaring three variables:
- `default` - a default color for modeline if no color is specified, which must be set to `$kak_opt_powerline_base_bg`, since it matches default modeline background color for current colorscheme
- `next_bg` - a tricky variable that will tell next module what background color it should use for it's separator. This is very important part, since without it smooth transition between modules isn't possible. It must be set to `$kak_opt_powerline_next_bg` which will be explained later.
- `normal` - a separator with solid body.
- `thin` - a separator with thin body.
After that we have `if` statement, that ensures that module isn't toggled `off`, and we actually need to draw our module in powerline. And if it is `on`, we do the following:
Declare two more variables for `$bg` is background and `$fg` is foreground colors, that are set to current module color. this is used to keep lines little more short, since variables have pretty long names.
Then we have another tricky `if` statement that defines what kind of separator will be used depending on our surroundings: if current background color and `next_bg` are the same - use `$thin` separator with these `$fg` and `$bg` colors. If not - then use `$normal` which will be colored in reversed format with `$bg` as foreground and `$next_bg` is background, and if `next_bg` is empty, use `$default` color. This statement can be copied to your module, because it is the same for every module.
After that we finally do two more things: add `%{$separator{$fg,$bg} â‰£ %opt{powerline_pos_percent} }` string to the end of `powerlinefmt` variable, which will later be passed to `modelinefmt`, and set the next background color to current background color.

That is. This is how you add a module to **powerline.kak**. So if you're writing a plugin, you can have this code inside your plugin, or you can send a PR with it and it will be included to **powerline.kak**.
